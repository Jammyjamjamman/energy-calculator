# energy-calculator
Educational tool for performing physics calculations.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/theimpossibleastronaut/energy-calculator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/theimpossibleastronaut/energy-calculator)

This program is a work-in-progress and has no real functionality yet.

## Design goals and specifications

1. Demonstrate E = mcÂ² . This just simply means show that mass is
directly proportional to energy (i.e. as mass increases, energy
increases). This should also show that energy and mass should **NOT**
be negative.

2. Talk about an application of this relationship. Two areas where this
is important; nuclear reactions (fission and fusion) and "radiation
pressure".

3. Talk about the [binding energy per
nucleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy). (The
most atomically stable element is Iron.)

4. Show that [nuclear
fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion) reactions produce
energy by converting mass into energy. This is because the "binding
energy per nucleon" increases when e.g. hydrogen is converted into
helium. This binding energy seen as the protons and neutrons losing
mass.

5. Show that [nuclear
fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission) reactions
produce energy (for more-or less the same reasons given above, but the
reactions are a bit more complex).

6. Calculate the energy produced when certain elements are used to
produce another (e.g. hydrogen is used to produce helium).

7. Give textual information to the user, which talks about concepts when
using energy-mass calculations.

8. Provide a GUI.

9. Design the package so that it can be used as an external library.
